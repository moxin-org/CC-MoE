## Introduction
The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by increasing capacity without raising computation cost. However, ultra-large MoEs like DeepSeek-V3 still pose challenges for deployment on memory-constrained edge devices.  
We introduce a collaborative compression framework that integrates expert pruning, activation adjustment, and mixed-precision quantization, reducing DeepSeek-V3’s storage from 1.3 TB to 103 GB while maintaining considerable accuracy. 

## Framework Overview

The overall framework architecture of CC-MoE. The middle part shows a block-level schematic of DeepSeek MoE. The left part highlights our Performance-Aware Expert Reduction and Pruning-Aware Activation Adjustment for FFN layers, while the right part illustrates the mixed-precision quantization process applied to the remaining model.

## Usage
For each component of this project, we provide detailed usage instructions and examples in the corresponding subfolder README files.  
Please refer to those for step-by-step tutorials and implementation details.
